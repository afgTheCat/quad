TODO:
  - state management fixes [DONE]
  - rerun logger [DONE]

    = This is a major downside of the project, what is something that we use nicely?
    = Needs to be embeddable
  - migrate to a new version of bevy
  - use combo box with egui [DONE]

TODO:
  - resurrect the whole project in order for me to be able to use my laptop
      => remove diesel, too much code
      => better structure
      => get betaflight to be able to running
      => test the thing real time
      => test replay
      => reproduce the initial test
      => add new training infa

Reservoir controller training TODO:
  - fully sunset `simple_training_strategy` (delete/deprecate entry points and tests) [DONE]
  - ensure buffered strategy uses buffered representation (e.g. `RepresentationType::BufferedStates(10)`) and document the 10-state window [DONE]
  - add representation before predictions are made [DONE]
  - fix `GyroState::gyro_update` to emit full linear_acc/angular_velocity vectors; inputs are junk otherwise
  - harden `snapshots_to_flight_input`/`FlightInput` against variable-length episodes (pad or truncate) to avoid panics
  - optional: re-run simulator when recreating replays instead of just swapping motor commands in the log
